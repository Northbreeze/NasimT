# Welcome to my blog

My name is Nasim. I’m currently working as a data scientist at BC Stats. I've finished my master of Data science from UBC in 2016. I’ve bachelor of Industrial engineering and master of Management Sciences from University of Waterloo. I worked 4 years in Deloitte consulting in toronto and vancouver. As a consultant, I saw how data analytics can help in solving marketing and customer relationship issues. Previous to that, in my master’s work, I learned about the theoretical frameworks for using data analytics to understand the behavior of individuals and groups.
I am hoping to fine-tune my data analytics skills, and use them to explore psychological and sociological phenomena. I believe that the intersection of Big Data and group behavior will yield crucially important insight in the next decades, and I want to be part of this change.
